# AI and ML Tools Repository

This repository is designed to provide hands-on tutorials and classes on both Generative AI and Classical Machine Learning techniques. The content is organized into two main sections:

1. **Generative AI**: Focuses on modern tools and frameworks like LangChain, suitable for building applications with generative AI capabilities.
2. **Classical ML**: Covers foundational machine learning algorithms and techniques such as regression, decision trees, etc.

## Repository Structure

```
repository/
|-- generative_ai/: Tutorials and examples for generative AI tools.
|-- classical_ml/: Tutorials and examples for classical machine learning techniques.
```

Each folder contains:
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive learning.
- A `README.md` file with a description of the classes in the folder.
